        As a cybersecurity consultancy, we hold our own infrastructure to the
        same standard we recommend to clients. This page covers how we
        approach our own security, and how to report a vulnerability if you
        find one.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-white font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-3">How we protect this platform</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Automated request inspection and blocking against common attack patterns (SQL injection, XSS, path traversal)</li>
        <li>Rate limiting and automatic blocking of abusive or brute-force traffic</li>
        <li>All administrative access requires authentication; sessions can be revoked at any time</li>
        <li>Security events are logged and reviewed</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-white font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-3">Responsible disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in Alux Plaza's
        own systems (not a client's — for client environments, follow their
        disclosure policy instead), we want to know.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-white font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Scope</h3>
      <p><strong className="text-white">In scope:</strong> aluxplaza.com and its subdomains, the Alux Plaza backend API and admin dashboard.</p>
      <p>
        <strong className="text-white">Out of scope:</strong> client systems assessed as part of our
        consulting engagements, third-party services we integrate with but
        do not operate, and denial-of-service testing of any kind.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-white font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">How to report</h3>
      <p>
        Email <span className="text-alux-cyan">security@aluxplaza.com</span> with
        a description of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and steps
        to reproduce it. Please don't publicly disclose a vulnerability
        before we've had a chance to address it.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-white font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What to expect</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Acknowledgment of your report within 5 business days</li>
        <li>Initial assessment within 10 business days</li>
        <li>Coordinated disclosure, typically within 90 days of report or upon fix, whichever comes sooner</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-white font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Safe harbor</h3>
      <p>
        We will not pursue legal action against researchers who make a
        good-faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, or
        service disruption, report vulnerabilities promptly, and comply with
        this policy.
