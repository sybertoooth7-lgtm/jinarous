      <p>
        These terms govern your use of the Alux Plaza website and any
        consulting services engaged through us. By using this site or
        engaging our services, you agree to the terms below.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-white font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-3">Our services</h2>
      <p>
        Alux Plaza provides cybersecurity consulting services, including
        vulnerability assessments, incident response planning, and
        compliance-readiness reviews against standards such as PCI DSS, the
        Kenya Data Protection Act 2019, and NIST SP 800-61. The specific
        scope, deliverables, and timeline for any engagement are agreed
        separately in writing before work begins.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-white font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-3">No guarantee of absolute security</h2>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity is a process of continuous risk reduction, not a
        one-time guarantee. Our assessments, recommendations, and tools
        reflect standard industry practice at the time they are delivered,
        but no consultancy — including us — can promise that a system will
        never be compromised. Findings and recommendations should be treated
        as professional advice for your own risk-management decisions, not
        as a warranty of security.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-white font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-3">Client responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        You're responsible for providing accurate information necessary to
        carry out an engagement, for implementing agreed remediations in your
        own environment, and for authorizing any testing performed against
        systems you own or control.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-white font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-3">Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>
        We treat client information, findings, and engagement details as
        confidential, and will not disclose them to third parties without
        your consent, except where required by law.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-white font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-3">Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the extent permitted by law, Alux Plaza's liability for any claim
        arising from our services is limited to the fees paid for the
        specific engagement giving rise to the claim. We are not liable for
        indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-white font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-3">Governing law</h2>
      <p>
        These terms are governed by the laws of Kenya. Any disputes will be
        subject to the jurisdiction of Kenyan courts.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-white font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-3">Contact</h2>
