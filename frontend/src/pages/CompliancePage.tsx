        Our assessments are grounded in established, publicly-documented
        frameworks rather than proprietary or black-box methodology. Below
        is what we reference and how we apply it.

          <h3 className="text-white font-semibold">PCI DSS</h3>
          <p>
            For any client handling cardholder data, we assess against the
            Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard's control
            requirements — network security, access control, encryption,
            monitoring, and more.

          <h3 className="text-white font-semibold">Kenya Data Protection Act, 2019</h3>
          <p>
            For clients processing personal data of individuals in Kenya, we
            assess lawful basis for processing, data subject rights
            handling, breach notification readiness, and data processing
            registers.

            Our incident response planning work follows NIST's Computer
            Security Incident Handling Guide — covering preparation,
            detection, containment, eradication, and recovery.

          <p>
            For clients building on large language models, we assess against
            OWASP's catalog of LLM-specific risks, such as prompt injection
            and insecure output handling.

      <h2 className="text-white font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-3">How we track it</h2>
      <p>
        For active clients, compliance status is tracked item-by-item — not
        as a single pass/fail — so you can see exactly where you stand
        against each requirement, and what's still outstanding.
      </p>

        If you're an existing client, you can view your live compliance
        status in the{' '}
