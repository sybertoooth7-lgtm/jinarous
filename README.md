A standards-based cybersecurity consultancy platform for SMEs in East
Africa, grounded in NIST SP 800-61, PCI DSS, and the Kenya Data
Protection Act 2019.

<!-- TODO: add a screenshot or short demo GIF of the client dashboard
     and/or admin dashboard here before publishing this README widely.
     A picture of the actual product is the single highest-value thing
     missing from this file right now. -->

- **Backend:** Node.js/Express (ESM), PostgreSQL, JWT auth (double
  cookie: separate `adminToken` for admins, `clientToken` for clients),
  CSRF via double-submit cookie, Postgres-backed rate limiting (no
  Redis dependency).
- **Frontend:** React 19 / Vite / TypeScript / Tailwind.
- **Repo:** `github.com/sybertoooth7-lgtm/jinarous`
- **Deploy:** frontend on Vercel (`jinarous.vercel.app`), backend on
  Render (free) with a Neon Postgres — see [RENDER_SETUP.md](RENDER_SETUP.md).
- **API reference:** [backend/openapi.yaml](backend/openapi.yaml) —
  every public and client-authenticated endpoint, with request/response
  schemas. Paste it into [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io)
  for an interactive view.

## Features

**Client portal** — signup with email verification, password reset,
session management, a live compliance checklist against multiple
frameworks, a computed risk score with a shareable verification link,
and a masked login-history view.

**Admin dashboard** — platform-wide compliance overview, client
management with per-client risk scores, contact-submission triage,
and security operations (active IP blocks with one-click unblock,
a filterable security-events feed).

**Security posture** — the platform practices what it sells: separate
JWT cookies per auth context, CSRF double-submit, account lockout with
escalating timeouts, enumeration-resistant auth responses, an
in-house request scanner (`backend/src/shield/`) that detects and logs
SQLi/XSS/path-traversal attempts, and Postgres-backed rate limiting
with no external cache dependency.

**Service methodology library** (`docs/`) — written methodologies for
ten consultancy offerings (incident response, vulnerability assessment,
compliance readiness, network hardening, backup/encryption review,
access-control audits, threat intelligence, honeypot monitoring, LLM
security review, post-quantum-crypto readiness), plus client-facing
deliverable templates.

**Audit tooling** (`tools/`) — standalone Python/Node scripts backing
several of the above services: authentication audits, backup audits,
network audits, a secrets scanner, an LLM security reviewer, and a
lightweight honeypot/reporting pair.

## Local setup

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
cp .env.example .env   # fill in DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET (random, ≥32
                       # chars, no dictionary words — config.js checks
                       # this at boot), CORS_ORIGIN
npm install
npm run migrate        # applies backend/migrations/*.sql in order
                       # (also auto-runs on every server boot)
npm run create-admin    # interactive prompt; or set ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL
                        # + ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD and skip this
npm run dev

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 npm run dev
```

`VITE_API_BASE_URL` is required for any production build
(`npm run build` fails fast without it — see `scripts/check-env.js`) so
the deployed frontend can reach a backend on a different host.

Use Node **20.x** for both packages (see the root `.nvmrc` and each
package's `engines` field) — it's what CI and the production Docker
images run.
